======================================================
Py2SIS v0.1 for Python for S60 3rd Edition, 15.12.2006
======================================================

This is a pre-release of Py2SIS for Python for S60, 3rd Edition. This tool has 
not been tested extensively, and it might cause problems in your device or SDK.

The tool can be used to package Python scripts to standalone applications on the 
desktop side. The packaged Python applications are no different from native 
applications to a handset user.

For an overview of how the Symbian platform security enhancements affect PyS60 
and Py2SIS (e.g. what are the options for signing), please see 
'PyS60_3rdEd_README.txt'.

For more information about tool usage, please take a look at "Programming
with Python for Series 60 Platform", chapter 14:
"Making Stand-Alone Applications from Python Scripts".

Prerequisites
-------------

 * A working version of S60 3rdEd C++ SDK installed. The installed SDK should 
 compile e.g. "helloworldbasic" example program.

 * Py2SIS also currently requires that the SDK configuration is subst'ed, this 
 means that e.g:

    C:\>subst
    S:\: => C:\Symbian\7.0s\Series60_v20
    T:\: => C:\Symbian\8.1a\S60_2nd_FP3
    U:\: => C:\Symbian\8.0a\S60_2nd_FP2
    V:\: => C:\Symbian\9.1\S60_3rd

 Py2SIS has to exist on the same subst'ed drive as your 3rdEd SDK, in the above 
 case the correct drive is 'V:'.
 
 * A working version of Python is also needed (tested with Python 2.4.2).

 * PyS60 installed on phone.

Usage
-----

Invoke e.g. with ("snake.py" is the script we are packaging):

    V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis>python py2sis.py snake.py --uid=0x01234567 
    --sdk30 --caps="NetworkServices LocalServices ReadUserData WriteUserData 
    Location" --leavetemp
    
Following is outputted:

    Processing template V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis\build\Icons_aif.mk.in

    Processing template V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis\build\PyTest_reg.rss.in
    Compiling...
    Done.
    makesis V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis\temp\snake.pkg V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py
    2sis\snake.sis
    Processing V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis\temp\snake.pkg...
    Unique vendor name not found.

    Created V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis\snake.sis
    
    Note: Sign the created SIS file prior installation (tool "SignSIS")

Here is the output without arguments:

    V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis>python py2sis.py
    
    Python to SIS
    usage: py2sis.py <src> [sisfile] [--uid=0x01234567] [--appname=myapp] [--caps="c
    ap_1 cap_2 ..."] [--presdk20] [--sdk30] [--leavetemp]
    
           src       - Source script or directory
           sisfile   - Path of the created SIS file
           uid       - Symbian UID for the application
           appname   - Name of the application
           caps      - A list of capabilities ("NONE", if caps is not given)
           presdk20  - Use a format suitable for pre-SDK2.0 phones
           sdk30     - Use a format suitable for SDK3.0 phones
           leavetemp - Leave temporary files in place
    
    By default, py2sis outputs SIS packages suitable for S60 2.X handsets.
    
    Packages for SDK3.0 phones are unsigned (use "SignSIS" for signing).
    
For signing the created packages use "SignSIS", example invocation:

    V:\cc\python\vob001\src\py2sis>signsis snake.sis snake.sis v:\keys\rd.cer v:\key
    s\rd-key.pem


Other information
-----------------

 * Outputs currently only gcce builds

 * The tool is not very verbose at the moment, if you run into problems, please 
 verify first that your SDK is working correctly (a proper test is to compile 
 "helloworldbasic") and to use the "--leavetemp"-switch with Py2SIS invocation. 
 After this you can investigate the contents of "temp" folder (especially ".pkg" 
 file and relations to the whole file tree under "temp")

 * The above is also useful if you want to investigate the internals of Py2SIS, 
 e.g. UID is added as postfix to file names due to flat file structure in 
 certain locations in S60 devices.

 * You can change the contents of the "\templates_eka2\python_star.svg"-file if 
 you want to use some other logo than the default one (currently the star and 
 the snake)

 * Currently you can only install the created packages to phone memory, not to 
 external memory cards.
